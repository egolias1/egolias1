### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly-motivated theoretical physics PhD graduate interested in data science and quantitative research with a strong desire to solve new problems, search for meaningful insights in complex datasets, develop innovative methods for the analysis of data, and construct insightful representations of data.

I recently graduated with a PhD in theoretical particle physics from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio where I worked with Pavel Fileviez Perez in the Particle Astrophysics Theory Group on phenomenological and cosmological aspects of theories for physics beyond the Standard Model. Before coming to CWRU, I graduated from Kent State University with a BS in Physics and a BA in Mathematics with a Minor in Italian Language and Culture.
