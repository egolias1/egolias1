### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly-motivated, aspiring data scientist with a strong desire to solve new problems, search for meaningful insights in complex datasets, develop innovative methods for the analysis of data, and construct insightful representations of data.

I recently completed my PhD in theoretical particle physics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio where I gained 5+ years of experience in teaching and mentoring and lead both independent and collaborative projects.
